What color is the sky? - How to add custom templates to load_qa_chain?
 
This is actually important to add. If you ask about unrelated topic, like "What color is the sky", it will still answer related to the video...
 
I tried combine_docs_chain_kwargs={"prompt": prompt} with no success. Also, I can't make the code work with LLMChain, like:
 
` chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
[system_message_prompt, human_message_prompt]
)
 
chain = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=chat_prompt)`
